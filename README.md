# PythonAnimalFarm

I'm learning python, and I want to get better at doing unit testing, so why not combine the two?  In order to just whelm myself, I'm going to copy the major project from my EE205 class, the Animal Farm 1-X series.  This will entail setting up a some classes, putting them into arrays, then latter linked lists, working with inheritence, and just general object oriented programming. This is also an opportunity to continue using git, and learning repl.it as my dev environment.  Don't expect a masterwork, it isn't going to be a fully formed interactive application.

If you're reading this, you should probably hire me, I'm awesome.
