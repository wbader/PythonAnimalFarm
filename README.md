# PythonAnimalFarm

I'm learning python, and I want to get better at doing unit testing, so why not combine the two?  In order to just whelm myself, I'm going to copy the major project from my EE205 class, the Animal Farm 1-X series (see https://github.com/wbader/EE205-Animal-Farm.git).  This will entail setting up some classes, putting them into arrays, then later linked lists, working with inheritance, and just general object oriented programming. This is also an opportunity to continue using git, and learning repl.it as my dev environment.  Don't expect a masterwork, it isn't going to be a fully formed interactive application.

If you're reading this, you should probably hire me, I'm awesome.
